I saw an interesting graphic the other day.

[CHART OF LIFE LEFT]

Your life, how much you lived and how much you have yet to live (on average).

Seeing this is another call to action if I've ever seen one.

Are you living the life you want?

It is exciting enough?

Those moments of missed opportunity that play in your head, use them to...

<h1>Reset  
&<br>
Redeploy</h1>

This is the life you have left.

â€¦ which is shown in the screenshot below:
