I began my Twitter account in 2015.

Yes, I'm embarassingly late to the game. I resisted the trend, <i>not another social media account to handle</i>. Now I'll say it loud and clear - I was a luddite.

Through my baby steps, I've found the world of Twitter to be a refreshing alternative to Facebook.

<li>You can friend anybody</li>
<p>While Facebook frowns on friending people you've never met, I'm free to follow the newsfeeds of Elon Musk or Richard Branson (until that day we share a private jet). Much more interesting than reading the updates of the guy I shared a desk cluster with in high school English.</p>
<li>It's easy to make friends!</li>
<p>No permission required, follow everyone and anyone you like. The more the better. I was plesantly pumped to see followers beginning with only a couple Tweets. I've had between 2 - 5 new followers a day from only sporatic updates of beer tasting, hiking, and eating.</p>
<br><br>
<b>Hypothesis:</b> What marketers pay thousands, millions, even billions of dollars for is available for anyone with the perserverance and tenacity.
<br>
<b>The Challenge:</b> Get 1,000 Twitter follows in a month.

It's time to change that.

So I'm making a mission. Get 1,000 Twitter followers within a month.

Some mental math informs me that's over 30 new followers a day. Not a light task considering I want this to be a part-time, not-too-intrusive activity.

Step one: Follow lots of people. I'll initially start with 10x the number I'm aiming for (i.e. begin following 300 people a day).

Step two: Engage my new friends. Not only follow & retweet, but send private messages with thoughtful & encouraging words (i.e. custom written, not some genertic cut & paste spam).

Step three: Keep producing new content. At least 3 posts a day minimum from my account, @empireofryan. So far I generally tweet about craft beer, Southern California hiking & fitness, front-end web development, and quality films.
